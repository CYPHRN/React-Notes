# React Notes

A simple note-taking app I built to practice React. You can add notes, delete them, and it looks pretty decent on mobile too.

## What it does

- Add new notes by clicking in the text area
- Delete notes with the trash button
- Responsive design that works on phones
- Clean UI inspired by React's color scheme

## Why I made this

Wanted to get better at React hooks and state management. Started with a basic tutorial project but ended up redesigning the whole thing to make it actually look good. It's nothing groundbreaking but it's a solid little app.

## Tech used

- React (hooks, components, the usual)
- Regular CSS with some gradients
- Create React App for setup
